# Volkswagen-IT-Challenge Submission

## Overview

We're developing an IoT and ML-based product to handle catalytic converter thefts in India.

## Problem/Business Need

Neglecting the vital catalytic converter in your vehicle has far-reaching consequences. It exposes your vehicle to theft, compromises fuel efficiency and performance, and harms the environment. If this issue isn't addressed effectively, it could lead to a surge in thefts, with converters fetching high prices in the black market. Alternatively, without proper care, these components will deteriorate, affecting both vehicle operation and environmental well-being.

## Solution

Our solution addresses two critical needs:

* **Vehicle Safety and Maintenance:** Our system monitors and detects exhaust system issues, ensuring safer and more efficient vehicle operation.
* **Catalytic Converter Theft Prevention:** Theft attempts to steal costly yet easy-to-steal component of your vehicle: The Catalytic Converter can be reduced.

**Features:**

* Continuous monitoring of exhaust system and real-time alerts for any issues
* Early detection system, especially valuable in developing countries like India
* Personalized maintenance schedules for drivers, enhancing vehicle efficiency and simplifying ownership
* AR-based training modules to analyze the condition of catalytic converter and teaching concerned workers the right way to clean it

## Key Stakeholders

Potential stakeholders include:

* Vehicle manufacturers
* Individual vehicle owners
* Insurance companies
* Police departments
* Car mechanics

## High-Level Technical Solution

We will deploy a sensor network within the exhaust system and around the catalytic converter to collect data on temperature, pressure, gas composition, and motion. This data will be securely transmitted to a central processing unit (CPU). AI algorithms will be developed for real-time anomaly detection, recognizing clogs, congestion, and theft attempts, triggering immediate alerts to vehicle owners through a mobile app or messaging. Theft will be monitored using NRF2401L (in a range of 100m), in case the catalytic converter is stolen from the vehicle. (Exception case: car mechanics)

A user-friendly interface, in the form of a dashboard or mobile app, will offer real-time status updates and maintenance scheduling. Additionally, data analytics will be performed on aggregated data to gain insights into vehicleâ€™s health and security.
